# files can be opened using the open("insert file name here",'mode') function
    # modes may be r : opens file to read, position at the beg; default mode
    #              w : opens file to write (makes new if file doesn't exists), truncates file, pointer at beg
    #              a : opens file to append, pointer at the end
    #             r+ : opens file to read and write, pointer at the beg
    #             w+ : opens file (new) to read and write; truncates if something already exists, pointer at beg
    #             a+ : open file to read and write, pointer at the end    


            # functions: 1. read()
            #            2. close()
            #            3. readline() : will read just one line of a text file
            #            4. truncate() : will clear the contents of the file
            #            5. write("stuff") : writes stuff to the file
