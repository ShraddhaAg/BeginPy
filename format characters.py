#lists:
`       #encapsuled in [] where each element is separated by ','
        # unlike C or CPP we dont need to define the type of lists`
        # deeclaration: var_name = [] (this is just deeclaration)
        # deeclaration with initialisation: var_name = [<write elements here separated by commas>]
        # first index is 0
        # last index is (n-1) as well as -1
        # all elements do not need to be of the same type (no concept in lists like int array the elements can be integer, character, boolean, string)
        # for 2D lists: [[<data>],[<data>],[<data>]]
