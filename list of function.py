# function in python (inbuilt)

round() #rounds the decimal values to integers following rules we studied in school

print() # will print strings in " " or ' '
        # will print varaibles (eg print x)
        # will print multiple varianles using + or , (eg print x + y [adds no space between the two strings] or print x,y [adds a space])
        # starting a new print statement means a new line unless the previous ended with a ','
        # we can do mathematical operation to print something (eg print '.' * 10 [it will print '.' 10 times with spaces in between])
        # \n also gives new lines (doesn't work wiht %r)
        # use """ """ triple qoutes to type long lines. ie goes across mutiple lines

raw_input([prompt]) # will just take input from user and return the input as of string type without new line
                    # if prompt is present then it will output [print] the prompt on the screen without a new line and wait for input; the input returned is without the prompt or the new line
                    # advised to use this over input() as input () tries to convert the input as if it is python code

open()  # built-in function
        # used to open files, takes parameter: filename and returns the file as an object
